## Time Table generation using Genetic algorithm  

•	Programmed Time Table Scheduling, a polynomial time verifiable NP-hard problem using genetic algorithms <br/>
•	Targeted to minimize the conflicts in the timetable in addition to developing a fitness function to reduce the search space <br/>
•	The core of genetic algorithm which was developed in Java 8 was tested on small and large timetable problems <br/>
